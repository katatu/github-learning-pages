I thought I have been using Github already and I was surprised I couldn't log in. All right, I registed and started with brand new space for my work.

I went through Git Hub Lab - Introduction and than Git Hub Pages to create this awesome blog. ;)

I have done this just in between waiting for download and than instalation of MySQL. The main task today is start creating my own wordpress theme using bootstrap. It seem more complicated than I expected :D Whatever. I managed to download
- wordpress itself (I have had it already)
- underscores theme (I have had it already)
- bootsrap somethnig
- font awesome
- tether (eventhough I have no idea what it is, they say bootstrap needs it; ok than)
- MAMP (cool!)
- MySQL - finally, I have done something wrong so for second time =) with a little help of someone from youtube video, speaking lovely indian language and making sure a few times that everybody understood which link he means, nice nice, I hade so much fun

I'm gonna continue learning something in Lab https://lab.github.com/ when I fell like.

I am using those tutorials:
